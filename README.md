# CARE-StudyTool
A small program to help with planning baseline testing

This is a small program that I am writing as I learn Python to hopefully assist the current Concussion research team and potentially future members after the current members leave. I am hoping to flesh this out as my skills with Python increase. Initially, it is simply a calculator for our needs but I am hoping to link it to our documents to better manage our large rosters.
